# pyconau15
Source code and data files for the PyCon AU 2015 tutorial, "Applied Data Science"

In order to run the examples and install the dependencies, users will need to
install either the Anaconda or Miniconda tool -- a Python package installer.

'install.sh' should then completely install all software needed to run through
the examples. All data needed for the tutorial is included in this repository.
Copies of this repository will be provided on USB keys on the day, but it would
be useful for people to get set up in advance if they are able.
